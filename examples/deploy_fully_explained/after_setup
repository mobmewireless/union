# Create stuff that isn't tracked by the repository, but is necessary for deploy actions to take place. A good example
# for this is the 'vendor/bundle' folder, which is an un-tracked shared resource that is generated by after_upload.

# tmp folder for holding restart.txt
mkdir shared/tmp

# shared vendor/bundle resources.
mkdir -p shared/vendor/bundle
